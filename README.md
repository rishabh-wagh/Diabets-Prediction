# Diabets-Prediction

In this project, I used the Kaggle Dataset of diabetes, taken from the hospital Frankfurt, Germany.

Firstly, I performed EDA and data leaning and after then applied following ML classification algorithms to predict whether is suffering from diabetes or not:
  
  * logistic_regression	
  * Decision_tree
  * Random_forest
  * SVM
  * XGBoost	
  
I determined the accuracies these algorithms using cross-validation and used the best algorithm for the prediction.
